# Calculator using JavaScript

This is a simple calculator using JavaScript. It is a part of my learning process of JavaScript. I have used HTML and CSS to design the calculator. I have used JavaScript to make it functional. I have used the eval() function to evaluate the expression. 

Also the calculator have a Dark Mode. That is activated by clicking the Dark Mode button in the right corner of the calculator.
